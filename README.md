# Calculator
## Implementation of a calculator using AndroidStudio
Another calculator project, only this time made entirely on AndroidStudio.

Like the TomCat servlet calculator, this too isn't yet finished.
***
## Available Operations
Although it is very similiar to the TomCat one, in this calculator the `elv()` method is available and functional.

Below a list of all currently available operations:

1. `sum()`
    * Adds two operands.
2. `sub()`
    * Subtracts two operands.
3. `mul()`
    * Multiplies two operands.
4. `div()`
    * Divides two operands.
    * An exception is thrown if a division by zero is performed.
5. `factorial()`
    * Calculates the factorial of a specified value.
    * An exception is thrown if said value is < 0.
6. `mod()`
    * Calculates the module of a value.
